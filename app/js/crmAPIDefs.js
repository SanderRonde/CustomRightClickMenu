Due to some issues with the chrome message passing API it is not possible to pass messages and preserve scope. This could be fixed in other ways but unfortunately chrome.tabs.executeScript (what is used to execute scripts on the page) runs in a sandbox and does not allow you to access a lot. As a solution to this there are a few types of functions you can chain-call on the crmAPI.chrome(API) object: a or args or (): uses given arguments as arguments for the API in order specified. When passing a function, it will be converted to a placeholder function that will be called on return with the arguments chrome passed to it. This means the function is never executed on the background page and is always executed here to preserve scope. The arguments are however passed on as they should. You can call this function by calling .args or by just using the parentheses as below. Keep in mind that this function will not work after it has been called once, meaning that if your API calls callbacks multiple times (like chrome.tabs.onCreated) you should use persistent callbacks (see below). r or return: a function that is called with the value that the chrome API returned. This can be used for APIs that don't use callbacks and instead just return values such as chrome.runtime.getURL(). p or persistent: a function that is a persistent callback that will not be removed when called. This can be used on APIs like chrome.tabs.onCreated where multiple calls can occuring contrary to chrome.tabs.get where only one callback will occur. s or send: executes the request Examples: - For a function that uses a callback: crmAPI.chrome('alarms.get')('name', function(alarm) { //Do something with the result here }).send(); - - For a function that returns a value: crmAPI.chrome('runtime.getUrl')(path).return(function(result) { //Do something with the result }).send(); - - For a function that uses neither: crmAPI.chrome('alarms.create')('name', {}).send(); - - For a function that uses a persistent callback crmAPI.chrome('tabs.onCreated.addListener').persistent(function(tab) { //Do something with the tab }).send(); - - A compacter version: crmAPI.chrome('runtime.getUrl')(path).r(function(result) { //Do something with the result }).s(); - Requires permission \"chrome\" and the permission of the the API, so chrome.bookmarks requires permission \"bookmarks\", chrome.alarms requires \"alarms\""},"GM":{"!doc":"The GM API that fills in any APIs that GreaseMonkey uses and points them to their CRM counterparts Documentation can be found here http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:API and here http://tampermonkey.net/documentation.php","!url":"/html/crmAPIDocs.html#gm","GM_info":{"!type":"fn() -> ?","!url":"/html/crmAPIDocs.html#gm-gm_info","!doc":"Returns any info about the script"},"GM_getValue":{"!type":"fn(name: string, defaultValue?: any) -> any","!url":"/html/crmAPIDocs.html#gm-gm_getvalue","!doc":"This method retrieves a value that was set with GM_setValue.
